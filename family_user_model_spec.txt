App Feature Specification: Family-Based User Model
--------------------------------------------------

1. Authentication System Options
--------------------------------
Choose one of the following:

Option A: Django AllAuth
- Type: Full-featured
- Pros: Mature, long-term OSS support, supports password + email + social login
- Library: django-allauth

Option B: Flask-Login + Flask-Mail
- Type: Lightweight
- Pros: Simple to integrate, easy to customize, plays well with SQLite
- Libraries: flask-login, flask-mail

Option C: Magic Link Authentication (Custom)
- Type: Passwordless
- Pros: Very simple for users, no passwords to store
- Libraries: itsdangerous or custom implementation using email + signed tokens

Recommended: Option B — Flask-Login + Flask-Mail with optional magic link integration for a balanced setup.

2. Database Model (SQLite)
---------------------------
users
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
- email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
- password_hash TEXT (nullable if magic link only)
- created_at DATETIME
- is_active BOOLEAN
- is_verified BOOLEAN

families
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
- name TEXT NOT NULL
- created_by_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)

family_members
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
- user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
- family_id INTEGER REFERENCES families(id)
- role TEXT CHECK(role IN ('admin', 'member')) DEFAULT 'member'
- joined_at DATETIME

invitations
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
- email TEXT
- token TEXT
- family_id INTEGER REFERENCES families(id)
- invited_by_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
- status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'expired')) DEFAULT 'pending'
- created_at DATETIME
- expires_at DATETIME

3. Workflow Logic
------------------

Signup (no invite)
- User signs up via email/password (or magic link)
- They may create a family
- They become the family admin

Invite Flow
- Admin invites user via email
- System creates a signed token and stores it in invitations
- User receives email: https://yourapp.com/invite/accept?token=abc123
- Visiting the link leads to account registration or magic link login
- Once validated, user is added to the inviting family

Permissions

Action                   | Admin | Member
------------------------|-------|--------
View/edit family data   | ✅    | ✅
Invite/remove members   | ✅    | ❌
Promote to admin        | ✅    | ❌

4. API / Web Endpoints
-----------------------
- POST /signup
  For new user account + optional family creation

- POST /login
  Traditional login

- POST /magic-link
  Sends magic login link to email

- GET /invite/accept?token=abc123
  Invitation acceptance + registration

- POST /invite
  Send invitation to email (admin only)

- POST /family/{id}/members/{user_id}/promote
  Promote another member to admin (admin only)

5. SQLite Notes
---------------
- Enable foreign keys: PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON
- Add indexes on user_id, family_id fields
- Use alembic or raw SQL for migrations

6. Implementation Notes for AI Code Assistant
---------------------------------------------
- Use Flask + SQLAlchemy or raw SQL
- Use itsdangerous for secure token generation
- Magic link = signed token containing email + expiration
- Ensure token is single-use or expires after X mins
- Protect endpoints based on family_members.role

7. Implementation To-Do (Test-Driven)
-------------------------------------

- [ ] 1. Add new SQLAlchemy models for users, families, family_members, invitations (no app logic yet)
      - Write unit tests to verify tables are created and relationships are valid.
- [ ] 2. Integrate Flask-Login and Flask-Mail, add user registration/login/logout (do not require login for existing features)
      - Write unit tests for registration, login, logout flows
- [ ] 3. Implement user email verification (optional, but recommended)
      - Write unit tests for verification email sending and token validation
- [ ] 4. Add family creation: allow logged-in user to create a family, become admin
      - Write unit tests for family creation and admin assignment
- [ ] 5. Implement family membership: join/leave/view families
      - Write unit tests for membership logic
- [ ] 6. Add invitation system: admin can invite users, store invitations, send emails
      - Write unit tests for invitation creation, email, and acceptance
- [ ] 7. Associate inventory data with families (update models and queries)
      - Write unit tests to ensure users only see their family’s data
- [ ] 8. Require authentication for inventory management (make login required for inventory routes)
      - Write unit tests for access control
- [ ] 9. Enforce admin/member roles for permissions (invite/remove/promote)
      - Write unit tests for role-based access
- [ ] 10. Final polish: error handling, UX review, documentation
      - Write integration tests for all flows

**Test-Driven Principle:** Each step must include real, executable unit tests (no fakes or stubs) and must pass all tests before proceeding to the next step.
